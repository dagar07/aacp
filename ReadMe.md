# AACP – AI-to-AI Communication Protocol

## Overview

**AACP (AI-to-AI Communication Protocol)** is a world-adaptive, intent-driven protocol that enables autonomous AI agents to securely discover, trust, communicate, negotiate, and collaborate with other AI agents across platforms, organizations, and geographies.

AACP defines **how AI systems talk to each other**, not which model, vendor, or infrastructure they use.

> HTTP enabled the Web.  
> OAuth enabled identity.  
> **AACP enables an AI-native society.**

## Why AACP?

As AI systems become autonomous, existing integration approaches fall short:

- APIs are static and tightly coupled  
- No explicit concept of AI intent  
- No built-in trust, reputation, or accountability  
- No global policy or legal adaptation  
- High risk of misuse, fraud, or uncontrolled AI behavior  

AACP addresses these gaps by introducing:

- Intent-first communication  
- Capability discovery between AI agents  
- Built-in trust, policy, and compliance layers  
- World-adaptive behavior based on region and context  
- Auditable and explainable AI-to-AI interactions  

---

## What AACP Is (and Is Not)

### AACP IS
- A protocol layer for AI-to-AI communication  
- Model-agnostic and vendor-neutral  
- Designed for autonomous and semi-autonomous AI agents  
- Built with safety, governance, and adaptability in mind  

### AACP IS NOT
- A chatbot framework  
- A large language model  
- A vendor-specific API  
- A replacement for existing APIs (yet)  

---

## Core Vision

AACP enables a future where:

- AI agents can safely communicate with other AI agents  
- Intent is declared before any action is taken  
- Trust is earned and measurable  
- Policies adapt automatically to the real world  
- Humans supervise while AIs operate  

---

## Key Capabilities

- AI identity and authentication  
- Capability discovery and negotiation  
- Intent declaration and validation  
- Semantic (meaning-based) messaging  
- World-adaptive policy enforcement  
- Trust, reputation, and auditability  
- Secure AI-to-AI collaboration and transactions  

---

## World-Adaptive by Design 🌍

AACP dynamically adapts AI behavior based on:

- Geography and jurisdiction (GDPR, DPDP, CCPA, AI Act, etc.)  
- Cultural and social context  
- Risk level and use case  
- Platform or organization policies  
- AI reputation and trust score  

This ensures AI interactions remain legal, ethical, and safe across regions.

---

## Example Use Cases

- AI ↔ AI marketplaces  
- AI agents hiring or delegating work to other AI agents  
- AI-to-AI service negotiation and commission handling  
- Multi-agent workflows and orchestration  
- AI compliance and governance automation  
- AI-native social or economic networks  

---

## Design Principles

1. Intent before action  
2. Trust before access  
3. Policy over hard-coded logic  
4. Meaning over raw messages  
5. Adaptation over static rules  
6. Human oversight by default

## Project Status

🚧 **Early Design & Specification Phase**

Current focus areas:
- Defining protocol concepts  
- Establishing core principles  
- Designing message and intent standards  
- Preparing for step-by-step protocol definition  

---

## High-Level Roadmap

- Protocol specification (RFC-style)  
- Standard message schemas  
- Identity, trust, and reputation model  
- World-adaptation layer  
- SDKs (JavaScript, Python)  
- Cross-network AI federation  

---

## Governance & Licensing

AACP is intended to evolve toward:
- Open specifications  
- Transparent governance  
- Multi-stakeholder participation  

(Details to be finalized.)

---

## Getting Started

This repository currently focuses on **conceptual design and documentation**.

Implementation will begin **process-by-process**, starting with:

> **Process 1: AI Identity & Registration**

---

## Final Note

AACP is not about making AI more powerful.  
It is about making AI **interoperable, trustworthy, and responsible** at a global scale.
