# Process 1: AI Identity & Registration
*AACP Protocol – Process Specification v0.2*

---

## Purpose

The **AI Identity & Registration** process establishes a **globally unique, verifiable, and accountable identity** for every AI agent participating in the AACP network.

This process is **mandatory** and acts as the **entry gate** to all AI-to-AI communication.

> **No Identity → No Trust → No Communication**

---

## Objectives

This process ensures:
- Verifiable AI ownership
- Jurisdictional and legal accountability
- Secure AI-to-AI authentication
- World-adaptive policy enforcement
- Auditable interaction trails

---

## Design Goals

| Goal | Description |
|----|----|
| Uniqueness | Every AI has a globally unique identity |
| Accountability | Each AI maps to a responsible owner |
| Security | Strong cryptographic guarantees |
| Adaptability | Region & law awareness |
| Extensibility | Supports future protocol evolution |
| Neutrality | Model and vendor agnostic |

## AI Identity Model (AI Passport)

An AI Identity in AACP consists of the following mandatory layers

- AI Identifier (AI-ID)
- Ownership & Responsibility
- Jurisdiction & Region
- Cryptographic Identity
- Capability Preview
